    "\n",
    "In this project, two topics were explored: unsupervised learning for galaxy image analysis and supervised learning for epidemic prediction (using some rpevious experience from Assignment 2 - task 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Topic 1, we use \"unsupervised learning\" to study images of the Milky Way galaxy. We apply K-Means clustering to find different regions in the images without any labels. First, we create several pictures(4) of galaxy areas using the mw_plot Python library [1], with different centers (like M31, the Andromeda Galaxy) and different viewing sizes. We then change the images into RGB arrays, where each pixel has three numbers for Red, Green, and Blue - (RGB). We tested different ways to encode the data, including grayscale (brightness), brightness categories, and color-based groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our K-Means results with 5-7 clusters work well to split the galaxy images into clear parts: dark background (space), bright stars, and middle areas like dust and gas clouds. When we tried different numbers of clusters, 3 clusters are too simple, and more than 10 clusters add too much noise. With 5-7 clusters, we get good results where about 45% of pixels are dark regions, 35% are medium brightness, and 20% are bright star areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also compare two methods: using only color features (RGB) versus using color plus position (x, y coordinates). Adding position helps find connected regions, while color-only clustering better groups similar star types no matter where they are in the image [2]. The clusters we find do not automatically match real physical parts of the galaxy like spiral arms [3], but these methods are still useful for processing large amounts of astronomical data [4, 5].\n",
    "\n",
    "In Topic 2, we compare different ways to predict epidemic spread, using Ebola data from West Africa . We first reproduced the SEIR compartment model from previous work, then train several machine learning models: linear regression, polynomial regression, a basic neural network, and an LSTM network for time series [6]. We used data from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to test which method works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results show that no single method is best for everything. The SEIR model gives good predictions and is easy to understand because it uses real biology [7]. Linear regression is too simple for epidemic curves. Polynomial regression can fit the data well but may overfit. Neural networks can find complex patterns but are harder to interpret [8]. LSTM networks work well for time series but need more data to train properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main lesson  from Topic 2 in our opininon and experience,  is that we cannot just ignore traditional models and only use machine learning. Mathematical models like SEIR help us understand why diseases spread, while ML models are better at finding patterns in data. The best approach combines both methods [7, 8].\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project shows that machine learning is a powerful tool for scientific problems [4], but it does has has its limits. In astronomy, clustering helps process millions of images [5, 6], but experts still need to interpret what the clusters mean. In epidemiology, ML can help with predictions, but domain knowledge is still needed to make good decisions. Both unsupervised and supervised learning work best when combined with human understanding."

    "#### **1 Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project studies two topics: unsupervised learning for astronomy and supervised learning for epidemic prediction. In Topic 1, we use machine learning to find patterns in images of the Milky Way galaxy, which has about 100–400 billion stars in a spiral shape [1,5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Because modern telescopes produce too much data to analyse by hand, we use unsupervised learning methods like K-Means clustering to group pixels by colour and brightness [2,4,6,7,8].\n",
    " \n",
    "We create images with the Python library **mw_plot** [1], turn them into RGB numbers, and then cluster them to see what kinds of regions the computer can find. In Topic 2, we use supervised learning to predict how diseases spread, using data from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.\n",
    " \n",
    "We first reproduce results from a SEIR model [5], then test linear regression, polynomial regression, a simple neural network, and an LSTM network for time series data [7]. Our main goal is to see what these methods can do, where they fail, and how they can work together with traditional scientific models [4,5,6]."
